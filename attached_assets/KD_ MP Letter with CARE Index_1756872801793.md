I am writing to brief you on the **CARE Index 2025** \- critical new research that directly impacts your constituents and presents immediate policy opportunities.

**The Challenge**   
The CARE Index 2025 (Caregiving and Ageing Readiness Evaluation) is Australia's first comprehensive assessment of our national preparedness for a rapidly ageing population. This landmark study commissioned by Violet reveals a critical finding: Australia scored just 23.1 out of 100 across five key pressure points \- preparedness, planning, emotional toll, relationship strain, and competing demands. We are dangerously underprepared for what lies ahead.

**Why This Matters**   
This result directly impacts your constituents and presents immediate policy opportunities.

* **{{percentage\_electorate}} of your constituents** are "Sandwich Generation" voters managing competing care responsibilities for elderly parents and their own children while attempting to remain in the workforce. 

* **88% feel unprepared and overwhelmed** by current or anticipated caregiving demands.  
  *Submissions from your constituents have been provided in this package.*

* **Almost 60% of Australians are already caring or will be within a decade,** with two-thirds being women who face a 42% lifetime earnings gap while performing the equivalent of a 31.7 hour unpaid second job.

* **$6+ billion annual economic impact** from inappropriate care settings, preventable hospitalisations and low-value care due to inadequate planning, guidance and family support.

* **Mental health crisis among family caregivers** is creating workplace absence, relationship breakdown, and financial hardship, affecting hundreds of thousands of voters.

**Why Act Now**  
Australia will experience a 400% increase in people reaching 85 years by 2031\. We have proven solutions ready for immediate implementation through existing infrastructure like the Carer Gateway (over $1 billion invested) and Violet’s technology-enabled platform already serving 30,000+ Australians.

**The Opportunity**   
This research provides you with media-ready solutions for high-priority constituent concerns, evidence-based policy frameworks, and the first comprehensive national data on Australia's fastest-growing voter issue.

I would welcome the opportunity to brief you further on how the CARE Index findings can support your advocacy for constituents facing these challenges.

**Yours sincerely,**

Kate Carnell AO  
Chair, Violet
